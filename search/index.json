How many ports are open? Answer: 4\nQuestion: What service is running on port 21? Answer: ftp\nQuestion: What service is running on ports 139 and 445? Answer: smb\nSince anonymous login is enabled on the ftp port, I tried that first.\nLooking through the scripts directory it seems there is a bash script and 2 text files so I grabbed them all. The scripts directory is also writeable.\nThis is a bash script that delete files from the /tmp/\nThe to_do.txt file is just a note saying to remove anonymous login.\nThe removed_files.log file is a log for clean.sh\nWith nothing left to look at on the ftp port, I moved onto the smb service with another anonymous login.\nQuestion: There\u0026rsquo;s a share on the user\u0026rsquo;s computer. What\u0026rsquo;s it called? Answer: pics\nI accessed the pics share.\nI grabbed by images and used stegseek to crack any possible steganography passwords.\nDespite trying 10million passwords none worked so I assumed there was nothing hidden in the images.\nI knew the scripts directory was writeable so I edited change.sh to include a reverse shell.\nI then uploaded that to the scripts directory\nI set up netcat to listen for the reverse shell and gained user access.\nThen I stabilised the shell.\nI got the user flag\nQuestion: user.txt Answer: 90d6f992585815ff991e68748c414740\nI looked for suid bits.\n/usr/bin/env stood out to me so I looked it up on gtfobins\nRunning /usr/bin/env /bin/sh -p gave me root.\nQuestion: flag.txt Answer: 4d930091c31a622a7ed10f27999af363\n","date":"2022-10-09T09:05:03-04:00","permalink":"https://demo.stack.jimmycai.com/p/anonymous/","title":"Anonymous"},{"content":"I started the the box with a simple nmap scan to know what ports were open and what was running on them.\nIt shows 3 ports open, 21(ftp), 80(http) and 2222(ssh).\nQuestion: How many services are running under port 1000? Answer: 2\nQuestion: What is running on the higher port? Answer: ssh\nAs shown by the nmap scan the ftp port has anonymous login enabled. I looked at that first.\nUpon logging into the ftp service, I found a directory called \u0026ldquo;pub\u0026rdquo; and within that a text file called \u0026ldquo;ForMitch.txt\u0026rdquo;. I used the \u0026ldquo;get\u0026rdquo; command to copy the file onto my local machine.\nThe \u0026ldquo;ForMitch.txt\u0026rdquo; file alludes to a weak password for the system user.\nNothing more to be found with the ftp login, so I moved onto the website running on port 80. What\u0026rsquo;s found at first is the default apache2 page.\nSo I started enumarting the website using gobuster to find directories.\n/simple seems interesting. It shows a cms homepage and at the bottom it displays which version of the cms software it is using.\nI searched for known vulnerabilities on that version and found this.
