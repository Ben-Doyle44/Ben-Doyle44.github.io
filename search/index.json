[{"content":"I started the the box with a simple nmap scan to know what ports were open and what was running on them.\nIt shows 3 ports open, 21(ftp), 80(http) and 2222(ssh).\nQuestion: How many services are running under port 1000? Answer: 2\nQuestion: What is running on the higher port? Answer: ssh\nAs shown by the nmap scan the ftp port has anonymous login enabled. I am going to look at that first.\nUpon logging into the ftp service, I find a directory called \u0026ldquo;pub\u0026rdquo; and within that a text file called \u0026ldquo;ForMitch.txt\u0026rdquo;. I used the \u0026ldquo;get\u0026rdquo; command to copy the file onto my local machine.\nThe \u0026ldquo;ForMitch.txt\u0026rdquo; file alludes to a weak password for the system user.\nNothing more to be found with the ftp login, so I move onto the website running on port 80. What\u0026rsquo;s found at first is the default apache2 page.\nSo I start enumarting the website using gobuster to find directories.\n/simple seems interesting. It shows a cms homepage and at the bottom it displays which version of the cms software it is using.\nI searched for known vulnerabilities on that version and found this. It contains a working exploit written in python.\nCVE-2019–9053\nQuestion: What’s the CVE you’re using against the application? Answer: CVE-2019–9053\nQuestion: To what kind of vulnerability is the application vulnerable? Answer: Sqli\nI run the python script with these paramaters:\nIt managed to find the username, email and password.\nQuestion: What\u0026rsquo;s the password? Answer: secret\nI\u0026rsquo;ll try to login in via ssh with these credentials.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s sucessful so I\u0026rsquo;ll now try to find the user flag.\nQuestion: What\u0026rsquo;s the user flag? Answer: G00d j0b, keep up!\nQuestion: Is there any other user in the home directory? What’s its name? Answer: sunbath\nI\u0026rsquo;ll use sudo -l to see what mitch is able to run.\nAs vim can run as sudo, I\u0026rsquo;ll look at vim on gtfobins\nQuestion: What can you leverage to spawn a privileged shell? Answer: vim\nWe can use sudo vim -c \u0026lsquo;:!/bin/sh\u0026rsquo; to get root and then read the root flag in root/root.txt\nQuestion: What\u0026rsquo;s the root flag? Answer: W3ll d0n3. You made it!\n","date":"2022-10-08T13:15:46-04:00","permalink":"https://demo.stack.jimmycai.com/p/simplectf/","title":"SimpleCTF"}]
